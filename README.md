shelter
======

A twitter clone in the shell.

## Compiling
* use `make` to make the ./shelter executable
* run `./shelter`, or use `make run` if you have xterm installed
* use a 151 by 51 window

## Controls

### Navigation
* use F1 to quit
* use the arrow keys to navigate between sections
* you can tell which section you are in by which heading is highlighted
* if no heading is highlighted, that means you are focused on the search section, which has not yet been implemented

### View twigs
* use j and k to navigate forward and backward, respectively, between records
* use the delete key to delete a record (key codes might not be the same for mac, linux, and pc)

### Add twigs
* when focused, type to enter text
* press enter when focused on the subject to move to the message
* press enter when focused on the message to submit the record

### That is all the functionality that has been implemented up to this point
