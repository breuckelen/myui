The templates should be viewed on no smaller than a 185 x 55 screen

Explanation:
    Shelter is so named because it is a twitter clone in the shell.  'Twigs' are the equivalent of tweets.
    This is an ambitious project.  It attempts to do a few things more than what is required.

        - First of all, it attempts to present a navigiable and aesthetically pleasing UI.  This is going to be accomplished through a 2D array 'map' containing pointers to various buffers.  Buffers will be structs containing a 2D array of characters, as well as the point of their absolute positioning on the screen, and name.  The arrow keys will move the user from one buffer to the next, updating a position variable of the users.  Based on which buffer the user is currently in, they will have different abilities.

        - Second, it attempts to implement a clean display of a list with scrolling and search capabilities.  For easy access, all entries in the mystore databse will be entered into an array of structs, which will in turn be displayed on the interface.  When the index of the element that user is focused on is greater than 5, the page will scroll down, displaying more entries.  Searching will be accomplished through a filtering function that creates a new array of entries that have a text match in either their subject or their body.


I hope that this goes well.
